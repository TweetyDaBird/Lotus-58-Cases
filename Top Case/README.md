## Lotus 58 Glow - Top Case
This case has a full printed top plate and can either use a standard bottom plate and spacers or simply have the PCB floating, held by the switches, depending on your anxiety level. Top bolts needs to be 6 mm long M2 to account for the thicker case.

Tented versions are suited for M4 bolts to raise the case up. Use decorative ones in aluminium/brass/whatever or basic stainless ones as you desire.
