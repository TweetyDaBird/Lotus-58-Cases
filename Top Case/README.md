## Lotus 58 Glow - Top Case
This case has a full printed top plate and can either use a standard bottom plate and spacers or simply have the PCB floating, held by the switches, depending on your anxiety level.

Tented versions are suited for M4 bolts to raise the case up. Use decorative ones in aluminium/brass/whatever or basic stainless ones as you desire.
