# Lotus58-Cases

## The 'official' 3D printed cases by MattBoog
3D printed cases to suit the [Lotus 58 Glow keyboard](https://github.com/TweetyDaBird/Lotus-Keyboard)

These were all modeled/designed by [MattBoog](https://github.com/MattBoog) ( @matthijsboog on discord ) from input, impossible ideas and testing by [TweetyDaBird](https://github.com/TweetyDaBird).

As licensed you are free to use them for your Lotus 58 builds, and or re-model them with proper attribution, but not offer them for sale. 

(If you for whatever reason want to do that, contact [MattBoog](https://github.com/MattBoog) to discuss permission)

## Known working cases from other designers
All cases are open source and the designs belong to their respective publisher, and are only listed here to make them easy to find.
