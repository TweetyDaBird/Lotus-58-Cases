# Lotus-Cases
3D printed cases to suit the Lotus 58 Glow keyboard

These were all modeled/designed by MattBoog ( @matthijsboog on discord ) from input, impossible ideas and testing by TweetyDaBird.

As licensed you are free to use them for your Lotus 58 builds, and or re-model them with proper attribution, but not offer them for sale. 

(If you for whatever reason want to do that, contact MattBoog)
