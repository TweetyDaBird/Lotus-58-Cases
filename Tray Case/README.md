## Lotus 58 Glow - Tray Case
A printed bottom tray that uses a standard top plate, using 9 mm spacers to mount the two halves together. 6 mm long M2 bolts recommended for the thicker bottom casing.

Tented versions are suited for M4 bolts to raise the case up. Use decorative ones in aluminium/brass/whatever or basic stainless ones as you desire.
