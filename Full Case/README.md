## Lotus 58 Glow - Full Case
A full enclosure with top and bottom replacing the sandwich style plates, using 9 mm M2 spacers to mount the two halves together. 6 mm long bolts recommended for the thicker casing.

Tented versions are suited for M4 bolts to raise the case up. Use decorative ones in aluminium/brass/whatever or basic stainless ones as you desire.
